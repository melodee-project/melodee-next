# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is an early-stage project and does not yet have formal release branches. As a rule of thumb, we aim to fix security issues on the current `main` branch and any actively maintained release branches (when they exist).

If you are running a fork or a pinned commit, you may need to manually backport patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in Melodee:

1. **Do not open a public GitHub issue.**
2. **Email the maintainers privately** with a detailed report if a contact address is listed in the project description or organization profile.
3. If no security contact is listed, you may:
   - Open a GitHub issue with the title containing **"[SECURITY]"** and only minimal, non-exploitable detail, asking for a private contact channel; or
   - Contact the repository owner account (`@melodee-project`) via GitHub with a brief note.

Please include, at minimum:

- A description of the issue and potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept if possible.
- Any ideas you have for mitigation or fixes (optional but appreciated).

We will try to acknowledge receipt of your report within **5 business days** and keep you updated on:

- Whether we confirm the issue.
- What versions are affected.
- Our expected timeline for a fix and disclosure.

## Disclosure Policy

- We prefer **coordinated disclosure**.
- Once a fix is available and reasonably tested, we will:
  - Patch the `main` branch and any relevant release branches.
  - Optionally publish a short security advisory or release note describing the impact and mitigation.

We appreciate responsible reports and will credit reporters in advisories if they wish (or keep them anonymous if requested).
